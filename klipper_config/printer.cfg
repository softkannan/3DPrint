# This file contains common pin mappings for the 2018 Creality
# Ender 3. To use this config, the firmware should be compiled for the
# AVR atmega1284p.

# Note, a number of Melzi boards are shipped with a bootloader that
# requires the following command to flash the board:
#  avrdude -p atmega1284p -c arduino -b 57600 -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -U out/klipper.elf.hex
# If the above command does not work and "make flash" does not work
# then one may need to flash a bootloader to the board - see the
# Klipper docs/Bootloaders.md file for more information.

# A note on pin names: pins may be configured with a hardware name
# (such as "PA4") or with an Arduino alias name (such as "ar29" or
# "analog3"). In order to use Arduino names, the pin_map variable in
# the mcu section must be present and have a value of "arduino".
# Pin names may be preceded by an '!' to indicate that a reverse
# polarity should be used (eg, trigger on low instead of high). Input
# pins may be preceded by a '^' to indicate that a hardware pull-up
# resistor should be enabled for the pin.

#   otherwise cause retraction followed immediately by pressure
#   buildup. This setting only applies if pressure_advance is
#   non-zero. The default is 0.010 (10 milliseconds).

#   target temperature range may accumulate before an error is
#   raised. For example, if the target temperature is 200, the
#   hysteresis is 5, the max_error is 120, and the temperature is
#   reported at 185 degrees for 12 seconds then an error would be
#   raised (or 24 seconds at 190, or 120 seconds at 194, etc.). The

min_temp: 0
max_temp: 110
#   The maximum range of valid temperatures (in Celsius) that the
#   heater must remain within. This controls a safety feature
#   implemented in the micro-controller code - should the measured
#   temperature ever fall outside this range then the micro-controller

[fan]

#   PWM output pin controlling the fan. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#max_power: 1.0
#   The maximum power (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the
#   pin may be set to. The value 1.0 allows the pin to be set fully
#   enabled for extended periods, while a value of 0.5 would allow the
#   pin to be enabled for no more than half the time. This setting may
#   be used to limit the total power output (over extended periods) to
#   the fan. If this value is less than 1.0 then fan speed requests
#   will be scaled between zero and max_power (for example, if
#   max_power is .9 and a fan speed of 80% is requested then the fan
#   power will be set to 72%). The default is 1.0.
#shutdown_speed: 0

# Micro-controller information.
[mcu]
serial: /dev/ttyUSB0
#   The serial port to connect to the MCU. If unsure (or if it

#   default is /dev/ttyS0
#baud: 250000

#pin_map: arduino
#   This option may be used to enable Arduino pin name aliases. The
#   default is to not enable the aliases.
#restart_method:
#   This controls the mechanism the host will use to reset the
#   micro-controller. The choices are 'arduino', 'rpi_usb', and
#   'command'. The 'arduino' method (toggle DTR) is common on Arduino
#   boards and clones. The 'rpi_usb' method is useful on Raspberry Pi
#   boards with micro-controllers powered over USB - it briefly
#   disables power to all USB ports to accomplish a micro-controller
#   reset. The 'command' method involves sending a Klipper command to
#   the micro-controller so that it can reset itself. The default is
#   'arduino' if the micro-controller communicates over a serial port,
#   'command' otherwise.

# The "auxboard" micro-controller will be used to control the heaters.
#[mcu auxboard]
#serial: /dev/ttyUSB1
#   The serial port to connect to the MCU. If unsure (or if it

#   print). This parameter must be specified.
#max_accel_to_decel:
#   A pseudo acceleration (in mm/s^2) controlling how fast the
#   toolhead may go from acceleration to deceleration. It is used to
#   reduce the top speed of short zig-zag moves (and thus reduce
#   printer vibration from these moves). The default is half of
#   max_accel.
max_z_velocity: 5
#   For cartesian printers this sets the maximum velocity (in mm/s) of
#   movement along the z axis. This setting can be used to restrict
#   the maximum speed of the z stepper motor on cartesian
#   printers. The default is to use max_velocity for max_z_velocity.
max_z_accel: 100
#   For cartesian printers this sets the maximum acceleration (in
#   mm/s^2) of movement along the z axis. It limits the acceleration
#   of the z stepper motor on cartesian printers. The default is to
#   use max_accel for max_z_accel.
#square_corner_velocity: 20.0
#   The maximum velocity (in mm/s) that the toolhead may travel a 90
#   degree corner at. A non-zero value can reduce changes in extruder
#   flow rates by enabling instantaneous velocity changes of the
#   toolhead during cornering. This value configures the internal
#   centripetal velocity cornering algorithm; corners with angles
#   larger than 90 degrees will have a higher cornering velocity while
#   corners with angles less than 90 degrees will have a lower
#   cornering velocity. If this is set to zero then the toolhead will
#   decelerate to zero at each corner. The default is 5mm/s.

# Support for a display attached to the micro-controller.
[display]
lcd_type: st7920
#   The type of LCD chip in use. This may be "hd44780" (which is

#   The pins connected to encoder. 2 pins must be provided when

#   must be provided when using menu.

[include gcode.cfg]
 
# A virtual sdcard may be useful if the host machine is not fast

# directly print gcode files stored in a directory on the host using
# standard sdcard G-Code commands (eg, M24).
[virtual_sdcard]
path: ~/.octoprint/uploads/
#   The path of the local directory on the host machine to look for
#   g-code files. This is a read-only directory (sdcard file writes
#   are not supported). One may point this to OctoPrint's upload
#   directory (generally ~/.octoprint/uploads/ ). This parameter must
