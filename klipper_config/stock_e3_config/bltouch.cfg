#pin: ar32
#   PWM output pin controlling the servo. This parameter must be
#   provided.

#   The maximum angle (in degrees) that this servo can be set to. The
#   default is 180 degrees.
#minimum_pulse_width: 0.0006
#   The minimum pulse width time (in seconds). This should correspond
#   with an angle of 0 degrees. The default is 0.001 seconds.

#initial_pulse_width: 0.0015
#   Initial pulse width time (in seconds) to set the servo to when
#   the mcu resets.  Must be between minimum_pulse_width and maximum_pulse_width.
#   This parameter is optional.  If both initial_angle and initial_pulse_width
#   are set initial_angle will be used
#enable: True
#   Enable or disable servo. It can be enabled or disabled later using
#   SET_SERVO SERVO=my_servo ENABLE=<0|1> g-command. The default is True (=enabled)

# Define a probe using the BLTouch
# Z height probe. One may define this section to enable Z height
# probing hardware. When this section is enabled, PROBE and
# QUERY_PROBE extended g-code commands become available. The probe
# section also creates a virtual "probe:z_virtual_endstop" pin. One
# may set the stepper_z endstop_pin to this virtual pin on cartesian
# style printers that use the probe in place of a z endstop. If using
# "probe:z_virtual_endstop" then do not define a position_endstop in
# the stepper_z config section.

#    SET_SERVO SERVO=bltouch ANGLE=60
#    G4 P200
#   A list of G-Code commands (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) to execute prior to each probe attempt. This may be
#   useful if the probe needs to be activated in some way. Do not
#   issue any commands here that move the toolhead (eg, G1). The
#   default is to not run any special G-Code commands on activation.
#deactivate_gcode:
#    SET_SERVO SERVO=bltouch ANGLE=90
#    G4 P100
#   A list of G-Code commands (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) to execute after each probe attempt completes. Do not
#   issue any commands here that move the toolhead. The default is to
#   not run any special G-Code commands on deactivation.

# BLTouch probe. One may define this section (instead of a probe
# section) to enable a BLTouch probe. A virtual
# "probe:z_virtual_endstop" pin is also created (see the "probe"
# section above for the details).

# Bed tilt compensation. One may define a [bed_tilt] config section to
# enable move transformations that account for a tilted bed.
#[bed_tilt]
#x_adjust: 0
#   The amount to add to each move's Z height for each mm on the X
#   axis. The default is 0.
#y_adjust: 0
#   The amount to add to each move's Z height for each mm on the Y
#   axis. The default is 0.
#z_adjust: 0
#   The amount to add to the Z height when the nozzle is nominally at
#   0,0. The default is 0.
# The remaining parameters control a BED_TILT_CALIBRATE extended

#points:
#    100,100
#    10,10

#    100,190
#    190,10
#    190,100
#    190,190
#   A list of X,Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) that should be probed during a BED_TILT_CALIBRATE
#   command. Specify coordinates of the nozzle and be sure the probe
#   is above the bed at the given nozzle coordinates. The default is
#   to not enable the command.
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the
#   calibration. The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#samples: 1
#   The number of times to probe each point.  The probed z-values
#   will be averaged.  The default is to probe 1 time.
#sample_retract_dist: 2.0
#   The distance (in mm) to retract between each sample if
#   sampling more than once.  Default is 2mm.

# Mesh Bed Leveling. One may define a [bed_mesh] config section
# to enable move transformations that offset the z axis based
# on a mesh generated from probed points. Note that bed_mesh
# and bed_tilt are incompatible, both cannot be defined.  When
# using a probe to home the z-axis, it is recommended to define
# a [homing_override] section in printer.cfg to home toward the
# center of the print area.
#[bed_mesh]
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the
#   calibration. The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#samples: 1
#   The number of times to probe each point.  The probed z-values
#   will be averaged.  The default is to probe 1 time.
#sample_retract_dist: 2.0
#   The distance (in mm) to retract between each sample if
#   sampling more than once.  Default is 2mm.
#min_point:
#   An X,Y point defining the minimum coordinate to probe on
#   the bed. Note that this refers to the nozzle position,
#   and take care that you do not define a point that will move
#   the probe off of the bed. This parameter must be provided.
#max_point:
#   An X,Y point defining the maximum coordinate to probe on
#   the bed. Follow the same precautions as listed in min_point.
#   Also note that this does not necessarily define the last point
#   probed, only the maximum coordinate. This parameter must be provided.
#probe_count: 3,3
#   A comma separated pair of integer values (X,Y) defining the number
#   of points to probe along each axis. A single value is also valid,
#   in which case that value will be for both axes. Default is 3,3
#   which probes a 3x3 grid.
#fade_start: 1.0
#   The gcode z position in which to start phasing out z-adjustment
#   when fade is enabled.  Default is 1.0.
#fade_end: 0.0
#   The gcode z position in which phasing out completes.  When set
#   to a value below fade_start, fade is disabled. It should be
#   noted that fade may add unwanted scaling along the z-axis of a
#   print.  If a user wishes to enable fade, a value of 10.0 is
#   recommended. Default is 0.0, which disables fade.
#fade_target:
#   The z position in which fade should converge. When this value is set
#   to a non-zero value it must be within the range of z-values in the mesh.
#   Users that wish to converge to the z homing position should set this to 0.
#   Default is the average z value of the mesh.
#split_delta_z: .025
#   The amount of Z difference (in mm) along a move that will
#   trigger a split. Default is .025.
#move_check_distance: 5.0
#   The distance (in mm) along a move to check for split_delta_z.
#   This is also the minimum length that a move can be split. Default
#   is 5.0.
#mesh_pps: 2,2
#   A comma separated pair of integers (X,Y) defining the number of
#   points per segment to interpolate in the mesh along each axis. A
#   "segment" can be defined as the space between each probed
#   point. The user may enter a single value which will be applied
#   to both axes.  Default is 2,2.
#algorithm: lagrange
#   The interpolation algorithm to use. May be either "lagrange"
#   or "bicubic". This option will not affect 3x3 grids, which
#   are forced to use lagrange sampling.  Default is lagrange.
#bicubic_tension: .2
#   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above
#   may be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated.
#   Larger numbers will increase the amount of slope, which
#   results in more curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.

# If the BLTouch is used to home the Z axis, then define a
# homing_override section, use probe:z_virtual_endstop as the
# endstop_pin in the stepper_z section, and do not set
# position_endstop in the stepper_z section.
# Homing override. One may use this mechanism to run a series of
# g-code commands in place of a G28 found in the normal g-code input.
# This may be useful on printers that require a specific procedure to
# home the machine.
#[homing_override]
#gcode:
#    ; G90   ; Uncomment these 2 lines to blindly lift the Z 2mm at start
#    ; G1 Z7 F600
#    G28 X0 Y0
#    G1 X100 Y100 F3600
#    G28 Z0
#   A list of G-Code commands (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) to execute in place of G28 commands found in the normal
#   g-code input. If a G28 is contained in this list of commands then
#   it will invoke the normal homing procedure for the printer. The
#   commands listed here must home all axes. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#axes: z
#   The axes to override. For example, if this is set to "z" then the
#   override script will only be run when the z axis is homed (eg, via
#   a "G28" or "G28 Z0" command). Note, the override script should
#   still home all axes. The default is "xyz" which causes the
#   override script to be run in place of all G28 commands.
#set_position_x:
#set_position_y:
#set_position_z: 5
#   If specified, the printer will assume the axis is at the specified
#   position prior to running the above g-code commands. Setting this
#   disables homing checks for that axis. This may be useful if the
#   head must move prior to invoking the normal G28 mechanism for an
#   axis. The default is to not force a position for an axis.
