#speedboatrace run on a (slightly) modified Ender 3.

Sorry about the noise, the camera is literally taped to the floor fan cooling the setup. I've reduced it as much as possible, to leave the sound of the printer somewhat clean.

The toolhead used is a custom design, it's available here:

X axis linear rail, custom toolhead, Sherpa Mini extruder, Dragon HF hotend, flexible coupler for Z rod, SKR E3 Turbo, Quickdraw probe. I think that's all of it. Sounds like more than it is when listing it :-)
bed springs with stiffer ones(just realized I had done that)
