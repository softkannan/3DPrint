#
# This file contains common pin mappings for MKS GEN L (v1.0)
# The MKS GEN L board uses a firmware compiled for the AVR
# atmega2560. This setup includes code needed for BLTouch
# to be used as the Z axis endstop, Mesh Bed Leveling using
# the BLTouch, a homing overide to bring the BLTouch to the
# center of the bed when homing the Z axis (This will work
# with either G28 to home all or G28 Z0 to home just the Z).
# This config also only turns the hotend fan on when it reaches
# a temp of 50c or higher (value can be changed).

# It may also be worth noting that I am using TMC2208 stepper drivers
# with this config in STANDALONE. See example-extras.cfg if you wish
# to run them in UART mode or use other stepper drivers.
# All stepper motors are stock ender 3 pro motors.

# *******MOST IMPORTANT NOTE OF ALL*******
# My MKS GEN L board had a bad pullup resistor on the z_min endstop pin.
# to combat this I swapped it for the z_max pin. For everyone else
# the sensor_pin: ^ar19 line under [BLTouch] should read.....
# sensor_pin: ^ar18

# Final note.....I promise.....
# I am using a Petsfang Bullseye fan duct with the BLTouch mounted
# on the left side. X, Y, and Z offsets were taken from my Marlin settings,
# however, I had to invert them for them to work correctly:
#---------------------------------------
#|  Marlin_Offsets |  Klipper_Offsets  |
#|-------------------------------------|
#| X |   -45       |        45         |
#|-------------------------------------|
#| Y |   -5        |        5          |
#|-------------------------------------|
#| Z |   -2.85     |        2.85       |
#---------------------------------------
# Your Z offset might be different depending on how you adjusted the
# mounting height of your BLTouch.

# See the example.cfg file for a description of available parameters.

#pin_move_time: 0.675
#   The amount of time (in seconds) to wait for the BLTouch pin to

#pin_up_reports_not_triggered: True
#   Set if the BLTouch consistently reports the probe in a "not

#   False.  The default is True.

#   Set if the BLTouch consistently reports a "triggered" state after
#   the commands "pin_up" followed by "touch_mode". This should be
#   True for a genuine BLTouch; some BLTouch clones may require
#   False. The default is True.

# Mesh Bed Leveling. One may define a [bed_mesh] config section
# to enable move transformations that offset the z axis based
# on a mesh generated from probed points. Note that bed_mesh
# and bed_tilt are incompatible, both cannot be defined.  When
# using a probe to home the z-axis, it is recommended to define
# a [homing_override] section in printer.cfg to home toward the
# center of the print area.

[bed_mesh]
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the
#   calibration. The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#samples: 1
#   The number of times to probe each point.  The probed z-values
#   will be averaged.  The default is to probe 1 time.
#sample_retract_dist: 2.0
#   The distance (in mm) to retract between each sample if
#   sampling more than once.  Default is 2mm.
#bed_shape: rectangular
#   Defines the shape of the bed for probing.  May be 'rectangular',
#   as is common for cartesian printers, or 'round', as is common for
#   delta printers.  Default is rectangular.
#radius:
#   Defines the radius to probe when the bed_shape is 'round'.  Note
#   that the radius is relative to the nozzle's origin, if using a
#   probe be sure to account for its offset. This parameter must be
#   provided if the bed_shape is 'round'.
min_point: 50,20
#   Defines the minimum x,y position to probe when the bed_shape
#   is 'rectangular'. Note that this refers to the nozzle position,
#   take care that you do not define a point that will move the
#   probe off of the bed. This parameter must be provided.
max_point: 178, 215
#   Defines the maximum x,y position to probe when the bed_shape
#   is 'rectangular'. Follow the same precautions as listed in min_point.
#   Also note that this does not necessarily define the last point
#   probed, only the maximum coordinate. This parameter must be provided.
#probe_count: 3,3
## OR ##
#probe_count: 5
#   For 'rectangular' beds, this is a comma separate pair of integer
#   values (X,Y) defining the number of points to probe along each axis.
#   A single value is also valid, in which case that value will be applied
#   to both axes. 'Round' beds only accept a single integer value that is
#   applied to both axes.  The probe count must be odd for round beds.
#   Default is 3,3 for 'rectangular' beds, and 5 for 'round' beds.
#fade_start: 1.0
#   The gcode z position in which to start phasing out z-adjustment
#   when fade is enabled.  Default is 1.0.
#fade_end: 0.0
#   The gcode z position in which phasing out completes.  When set
#   to a value below fade_start, fade is disabled. It should be
#   noted that fade may add unwanted scaling along the z-axis of a
#   print.  If a user wishes to enable fade, a value of 10.0 is
#   recommended. Default is 0.0, which disables fade.
#fade_target:
#   The z position in which fade should converge. When this value is set
#   to a non-zero value it must be within the range of z-values in the mesh.
#   Users that wish to converge to the z homing position should set this to 0.
#   Default is the average z value of the mesh.
#split_delta_z: .025
#   The amount of Z difference (in mm) along a move that will
#   trigger a split. Default is .025.
#move_check_distance: 5.0
#   The distance (in mm) along a move to check for split_delta_z.
#   This is also the minimum length that a move can be split. Default
#   is 5.0.
#mesh_pps: 2,2
#   A comma separated pair of integers (X,Y) defining the number of
#   points per segment to interpolate in the mesh along each axis. A
#   "segment" can be defined as the space between each probed
#   point. The user may enter a single value which will be applied
#   to both axes.  Default is 2,2.
#algorithm: lagrange
#   The interpolation algorithm to use. May be either "lagrange"
#   or "bicubic". This option will not affect 3x3 grids, which
#   are forced to use lagrange sampling.  Default is lagrange.
#bicubic_tension: .2
#   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above
#   may be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated.
#   Larger numbers will increase the amount of slope, which
#   results in more curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.

# Heater cooling fans (one may define any number of sections with a
# "heater_fan" prefix). A "heater fan" is a fan that will be enabled
# whenever its associated heater is active. By default, a heater_fan
# has a shutdown_speed equal to max_power.

#   Name of the config section defining the heater that this fan is
#   associated with. If a comma separated list of heater names is
#   provided here, then the fan will be enabled when any of the given
#   heaters are enabled. The default is "extruder".
#heater_temp: 50.0
#   A temperature (in Celsius) that the heater must drop below before
#   the fan is disabled. The default is 50 Celsius.
#fan_speed: 1.0
#   The fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the fan
#   will be set to when its associated heater is enabled. The default
#   is 1.0
