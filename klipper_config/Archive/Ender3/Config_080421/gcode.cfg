# G-Code macros and events
######################################################################

# G-Code macros (one may define any number of sections with a
# "gcode_macro" prefix).
#[gcode_macro my_cmd]
#gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute in place of "my_cmd". See
#   docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This parameter must
#   be provided.
#default_parameter_<parameter>:
#   One may define any number of options with a "default_parameter_"
#   prefix. Use this to define default values for g-code parameters.
#   For example, if one were to define the macro MY_DELAY with gcode
#   "G4 P{DELAY}" along with "default_parameter_DELAY = 50" then the
#   command "MY_DELAY" would evaluate to "G4 P50". The default is to
#   require that all parameters used in the gcode script be present in
#   the command invoking the macro.
#variable_<name>:
#   One may specify any number of options with a "variable_" prefix.
#   The given variable name will be assigned the given value (parsed
#   as a Python literal) and will be available during macro expansion.
#   For example, a config with "variable_fan_speed = 75" might have
#   gcode commands containing "M106 S{ fan_speed * 255 }". Variables
#   can be changed at run-time using the SET_GCODE_VARIABLE command.

# Execute a gcode on a set delay.
#[delayed_gcode my_delayed_gcode]
#initial_duration: 0.
#   The duration of the initial delay (in seconds).  If set to a non-zero
#   value the delayed_gcode will execute the specified number of seconds
#   after the printer enters the "ready" state.  This can be useful for
#   initialization procedures or a repeating delayed_gcode.  If set to 0
#   the delayed_gcode will not execute on startup.  Default is 0.
#gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute when the delay duration has
#   elapsed.  G-Code templates are supported.  This parameter must be
#   provided.

# Idle timeout. An idle timeout is automatically enabled - add an
# explicit idle_timeout config section to change the default settings.
#[idle_timeout]
#gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute on an idle timeout. See
#   docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. The default is to run
#   "TURN_OFF_HEATERS" and "M84".
#timeout: 600
#   Idle time (in seconds) to wait before running the above G-Code
#   commands. The default is 600 seconds.


#[gcode_macro M300]
#default_parameter_S=1000
#   Allows for a default 1kHz tone if S is omitted
#default_parameter_P=100
#   Allows for a default 10ms duration is P is omitted
#gcode:  SET_PIN PIN=BEEPER_pin VALUE={S}
#        G4 P{P}
#        SET_PIN PIN=BEEPER_pin VALUE=0

# Optional G-Code features
######################################################################

# A virtual sdcard may be useful if the host machine is not fast
# enough to run OctoPrint well. It allows the Klipper host software to
# directly print gcode files stored in a directory on the host using
# standard sdcard G-Code commands (eg, M24).
[virtual_sdcard]
path: ~/.octoprint/uploads/
#   The path of the local directory on the host machine to look for
#   g-code files. This is a read-only directory (sdcard file writes
#   are not supported). One may point this to OctoPrint's upload
#   directory (generally ~/.octoprint/uploads/ ). This parameter must
#   be provided.

# Support manually moving stepper motors for diagnostic purposes.
# Note, using this feature may place the printer in an invalid state -
# see docs/G-Codes.md for important details.
[force_move]
enable_force_move: True
#   Set to true to enable FORCE_MOVE and SET_KINEMATIC_POSITION
#   extended G-Code commands. The default is false.

# Pause/Resume functionality with support of position capture and restore
#[pause_resume]
#recover_velocity: 50.
#   When capture/restore is enabled, the speed at which to return to
#   the captured position (in mm/s).  Default is 50.0 mm/s.

# Firmware filament retraction. This enables G10 (retract) and G11
# (unretract) GCODE commands issued by many slicers. The parameters
# below provide startup defaults, although the values can be adjusted
# via the SET_RETRACTION command, allowing per-filament settings and
# runtime tuning.
#[firmware_retraction]
#retract_length: 0
#   The length of filament (in mm) to retract when G10 is activated, and to
#   unretract when G11 is activated (but see unretract_extra_length below).
#   The default is 0 mm.
#retract_speed: 20
#   The speed of retraction, in mm/s. The default is 20 mm/s.
#unretract_extra_length: 0
#   The length (in mm) of *additional* filament to add when unretracting.
#unretract_speed: 10
#   The speed of unretraction, in mm/s. The default is 10 mm/s.

# enables arc (G2/G3) commands. Only IJ version is supported
# example: "G2 X125 Y32 Z10 E5 I10.5 J10.5"
#[gcode_arcs]
#resolution: 1.0
#   An arc will be split into segments. Each segment's length will equal
#   the resolution in mm set above. Lower values will produce a finer arc,
#   but also more work for your machine. Arcs smaller than the configured
#   value will become straight lines.

# Enable the "M118" and "RESPOND" extended commands.
[respond]
# default_type: echo
#    Sets the default prefix of the "M118" and "RESPOND" output to one of
#    the following:
#        echo: "echo: " (This is the default)
#        command: "// "
#        error: "!! "
# default_prefix: echo:
#    Directly sets the default prefix. If present, this value will override
#    the "default_type".
