pin: !ar2
z_offset: 0

activate_gcode:
  G4 P750
#   A list of G-Code commands (one per line) to execute prior to each
#   probe attempt. This may be useful if the probe needs to be
#   activated in some way. The default is to not run any special
#   G-Code commands on activation.
#deactivate_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands (one per line) to execute after each
#   probe attempt completes. The default is to not run any special
#   G-Code commands on deactivation.


# Mesh Bed Leveling. One may define a [bed_mesh] config section
# to enable move transformations that offset the z axis based
# on a mesh generated from probed points. Note that bed_mesh
# and bed_tilt are incompatible, both cannot be defined.
[bed_mesh]
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the
#   calibration. The default is 50.
horizontal_move_z: 2.5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
min_point: 10,10
#   An X,Y point defining the minimum coordinate to probe on
#   the bed. Note that this refers to the nozzle position,
#   and take care that you do not define a point that will move
#   the probe off of the bed. This parameter must be provided.
max_point: 300, 290
#   An X,Y point defining the maximum coordinate to probe on
#   the bed. Follow the same precautions as listed in min_point.
#   Also note that this does not necessarily define the last point
#   probed, only the maximum coordinate. This parameter must be provided.
probe_count: 4,4
#   A comma separated pair of integer values (X,Y) defining the number
#   of points to probe along each axis. A single value is also valid,
#   in which case that value will be for both axes. Default is 3,3
#   which probes a 3x3 grid.
#fade_start: 1.0
#   The z-axis position in which to start phasing z-adjustment out.
#   Default is 1.0.
#fade_end: 10.0
#   The gcode z position in which phasing out completes.  When set
#   to a value below fade_start, fade is disabled. It should be
#   noted that fade may add unwanted scaling along the z-axis of a
#   print.  If a user wishes to enable fade, a value of 10.0 is
#   recommended. Default is 0.0, which disables fade.
# fade_target:
#   The z position in which fade should converge. When this value is set
#   to a non-zero value it must be within the range of z-values in the mesh.
#   Users that wish to converge to the z homing position should set this to 0.
#   Default is the average z value of the mesh.

#split_delta_z: .025
#   The amount of Z difference (in mm) along a move that will
#   trigger a split. Default is .025.
#move_check_distance: 5.0
#   The distance (in mm) along a move to check for split_delta_z.
#   This is also the minimum length that a move can be split. Default
#   is 5.0.
#mesh_pps: 2,2
#   A comma separated pair of integers (X,Y) defining the number of
#   points per segment to interpolate in the mesh along each axis. A
#   "segment" can be defined as the space between each probed
#   point. The user may enter a single value which will be applied
#   to both axes.  Default is 2,2.
#algorithm: lagrange
#   The interpolation algorthm to use. May be either "langrange"
#   or "bicubic". This option will not affect 3x3 grids, which
#   are forced to use lagrange sampling.  Default is lagrange.
#bicubic_tension: .2
#   When using the bicubic algoritm the tension parameter above
#   may be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated.
#   Larger numbers will increase the amount of slope, which
#   results in more curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.
samples: 3
#   The number of times to probe each point.  The probed z-values
#   will be averaged.  The default is to probe 1 time.
sample_retract_dist: 1.5
#   The distance (in mm) to retract between each sample if
#   sampling more than once.  Default is 2mm.
#manual_probe:
#   See the manual_probe option of [bed_tilt] for details. The default
#   is false if a [probe] config section is present and true otherwise.
