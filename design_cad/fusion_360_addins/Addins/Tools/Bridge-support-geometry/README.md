# Fusion 360 Bridge support geometry addin
Addin for Fusion 360 CAD software to create support geometry for 3D printed models.
Macro creates support geometry, which allows you print horizontal planes as bridge. Macro is suitable for technical parts with orthogonal geometry.

## Features
- Quick geometry generation based on selected line/s
- Definable angle of wall to avoid contact with model
- Definable nozzle diameter for correct calculation of contact surface
- Definable base plane, which allows to generate geometry from models plane
- Support geometry created in this way are very easy to remove
- Support geometry created in this way can be distributed directly in model
- Support geometry is in model tree generated as separated and structured container


## Prerequisites
- Models first layer plane needs to be aligned with Origin XY plane in correct Z direction


## Notes
- Check [this](https://youtu.be/LHlSZSK748o?t=252) video section if you want to generate geometry in existing STL
