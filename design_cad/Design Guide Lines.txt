Design Guide Lines

-no overhangs over 45 degrees
-no supports (unless they are absolutely needed, and if that's the case they must be built in to the part)
-0.4mm chamfer on surfaces that touch the print bed (and no fillets on the build surface--breaks the 45 degree overhang rule)
-loose joints generally oversized by 0.3-0.4mm diameter for loose fit or 0.1mm for press fit. 3.4mm for M3 hardware, 5.4mm for M5 hardware
-general "nice" aesthetic
-Take note of part orientation to make sure the part is strong in the directions it needs to be.
-Countersunk holes "overhanging" the print surface should have a chamfer on them or other method like that to prevent issues
-Think about minimum perimeters/shells--try to avoid really thin features
-Design with common screws/hardware in mind. Ie, stick with M3x6,8,12,16,20,30,40, M5x10,16,30,40 when possible (for V1/V2)

 There are several reason for belt driven Z:
 1) It’s a lot more compact allowing for tighter packaging and more build volume.
 2) It’s backlash-free so it’s more akin to ball screws on performance side.
 3) It doesn’t bind on extreme angles. Yes we could use a ball lead screw nut (like what IGUS has) with some freedom built in but you’d be sacrificing space inside.

 But the biggest reason by far is belts don’t lead to Z artifacts.
 It’s hard to find good lead screws on the cheap. It’s harder to find 4 lead screws on the cheap. 
 Belts allow gantry to be affixed in XY plane by MGN9 carts only and don’t introduce lateral forces into the equation.
 This allows to much higher precision Z motion even with cheap components.
