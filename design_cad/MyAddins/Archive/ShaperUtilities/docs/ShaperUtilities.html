<p>Shape Utilities will provide a range of workflow improvements enhancing Shaper products.</p>

<p>Initially Shaper Origin (our hand held CNC) receives a two click export feature. Eliminating the time lost to complicated and cumbersome export procedures.</p>

<p>Origin users will appreciate spending their time fabricating, iterating and experimenting on their terms.</p></div></div>

            <div class="helpdoc-text">Once the design is modeled suitably for cutting with Origin, in modeling mode, press the Shaper button at the top of the screen.<br><br>

The export panel will be presented prompting you to select a face to define an "up" facing surface. Origin will be cutting from on the body you wish to export. <br><br>The add-in will automatically identify all cutting geometry facing "up", identifying the cut type necessary to produce them.<br><br>

Pressing "OK" will prompt for an export file name and destination directory, the name of the selected body is pre-populated as the file name.<br><br>

The file exported is a correctly scaled, named and color-coded SVG file ready to cut with Origin. Place the file on a thumb drive, or upload to "myhub" and begin cutting right away. <br><br>

For complete instructions, hit the ? button in the bottom left corner of the app panel.</div>
