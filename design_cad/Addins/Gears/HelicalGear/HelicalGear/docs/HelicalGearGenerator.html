			<p>Helical gears resemble spur gears with the teeth at an angle. They can be meshed in parallel or crossed orientations at 90 degrees or arbitrary angles and can be generated with as little as a single tooth forming a screw gear.</p>

<p>Gears may be specified in either the 'Normal' or the 'Radial' system or the fixed profile Sunderland standard, any of which can be generated as either Left or Right handed. Handedness in helical gears refers to the direction the teeth lean when the gear is placed flat on a table.</p>

<p>Using this add-in, proper Herringbone gears (such as the gears used for this add-in's thumbnail) can be created by using a Sunderland profile then mirroring the gear about one of its faces. In the case of Herringbone or other double-helix gears the handedness of the base gear is not as significant as it is for single helix gears - to effectively change the handedness of a Herringbone / double helix gear all you need to do is flip it over - whereas for a single helix gear it must be mirrored to change its handedness.</p>

<p>Finally, by setting a helix angle of 0 degrees, Spur gears can be created and defined in the metric system (as opposed to the sample Spur Gear script which defines gears in the American system) with this add-in.</p>

<p><strong>Description of inputs</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gear Standards</strong>:</p>
<p>The true involute pitch and involute geometry of a helical gear is in the plane of rotation (Radial System). However, because of the nature of tooth generation with a rack-type hob, a single tool can generate helical gears at all helix angles as well as standard spur gears. However, this means the normal pitch is the common denominator, and usually is taken as a standard value (e.g. 14.5 deg or most commonly 20 deg). In other words if you plan to have your gear manufactured with a standard hob you will likely want to use the "Normal System" and a pressure Angle of 20 degrees.</p>
<p><strong>Normal System</strong>: Pressure angle and module are defined relative to the normal of the tooth (i.e. defined as if the tooth was rotated by the helix angle). When defining a gear in the normal system changes to the Helix Angle will cause the gears diameter to change as well as the working thickness (and therefore the strength) of the tooth.</p>
<p><strong>Radial System</strong>: Pressure angle and module are defined relative to the plane of rotation. When defining a gear in the radial system changes to the Helix Angle does NOT affect the gear diameter but it does change the "normal pressure angle" which may require custom tooling to have the gear manufactured (obviously this is not an issue if 3D printing the part).</p>
<p><strong>Sunderland</strong>: The Sunderland machine is commonly used to make a double helical gear, or herringbone, gear. The radial pressure angle and helix angle are fixed at 20° and 22.5°, respectively. &nbsp;The tooth profile of Sunderland gears is also slightly shorter (and therefore stronger) than equivalent gears defined in the radial system.</p>
<p><strong>Handedness</strong>: Direction the tooth appears to lean when placed flat on a table.</p>
<p>Helical gears of <strong>opposite hand</strong> operate on <strong>parallel shafts</strong>.</p>
<p>Helical gears of the <strong>same hand</strong> operate at <strong>right angles</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Helix Angle</strong>: Angle of tooth twist. 0 degrees produces a standard spur gear. The higher the helix angle the more twist the gear has.</p>
<p><strong>Pressure Angle</strong>: The pressure angle defines the angle of the line of action which is a common tangent between the two base circles of a pair of gears. The short of it is this: leave this value at 20 degrees until you have reason to do otherwise - but know that any pair of gears MUST have the same pressure angle.</p>
<p><strong>Module</strong>: The module is the length of pitch diameter per tooth. Therefore m = d / z; where m is module, d is the pitch diameter of the gear, and z is the number of teeth.</p>
<p><strong>Teeth</strong>: Number of teeth the gear has. The higher the helix angle, and to some extent pressure angle, are the fewer teeth the gear needs to have to avoid undercutting. It is possible to create a Helical gear with a single tooth given a high enough Helix Angle. <strong>CAUTION: due to performance reasons, do not make gears with several hundred teeth</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Backlash</strong>: [experimental] a positive value here causes each tooth to be slightly narrower than the ideal tooth. In the real world having a perfect tooth is not often desired, it is better to build in a little backlash to reduce friction, allowing room for lubricant between teeth, and to prevent jamming. Backlash is allowed to also be negative which has no real world application I'm aware of but may be useful for compensating for undersized teeth which were 3D printed, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Gear Thickness</strong>: How thick you want the gear to be. <strong>CAUTION: making a gear really thick can cause some serious performance issues</strong>. If you wish to make a gear where the teeth wrap around multiple times I recommend seeing the "length per revolution" field in the "Gear Parameters" readout and using that value for your gear thickness then copy/rectangular pattern the gear body to reach your desired length. This is something which may be addressed in a future release.</p>
<p><strong>Preview (checkbox)</strong>: When checked the full gear will be generated and updated as you change parameters. For performance reasons you may wish to leave this unchecked - especially for gears with over 100 teeth.</p>
<p><strong>Gear Parameters</strong>: Presents a readout of all significant gear parameters calculated for your specified gear. It is advised that you check this section for a warning of UNDERCUT REQUIRED. This tool does not perform tooth undercutting at this time! <strong>If you encounter UNDERCUT REQUIRED</strong> you can do one or more of: increase the number of teeth; increase the Helix Angle; increase the pressure Angle.</p>

<p>To create gears that mesh at nonparallel and nonintersecting axes the sum of their helix angles must equal the shaft angle. You can treat right hand gears as having a positive angle and left hand gears as having a negative angle. There are many solutions for any given shaft angle E.g. 22.5(R) + 22.5(R) = 45; and 65(R) + -20(L) = 45</p></div>

All tooth profiles are now created on their own sketches. This is a workaround for a Fusion bug where sketch profiles are not always properly recognized when sketched off of z=0.

1.0.2
Fixing various bugs broken by, or exposed by, recent changes to Fusion.
* Textboxes no longer appear to support list formatting - this was causing ERROR messages to be suppressed.
* Expanding the Gear Parameters group was causing an infinite preview loop leading to very poor performance and likely causing crashes.
** Having the Gear Parameters expanded and having preview enabled still carries a performance penalty of causing the preview to be generated multiple times instead of just once.
** It can take a few clicks to get the Gear Parameters group to expand
** all-in-all Fusion does not yet support the concept of providing messaging to the user in a way which does not trigger the preview to be regenerated

Other changes:
* Number of teeth can now be set from a user parameter (gear is not updated if the parameter is changed after gear generation)
* Increased the number of decimal places to nine for 'length per revolution' in Gear Parameters</td>
