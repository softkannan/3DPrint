## Gates 2GT Specifications

2GT belts are manufactured by an affiliate company of Gates called "Gates Unitta", in Asia. Gates 2GT belts are using a different profile than GT2/GT3. As they are not 100% compatible with GT2/GT3 they could lead to an increase in backlash and belt wear, specially on a 3D printer.

## Gates GT3 Specifications

GT2 and GT3 belts are made by "Gates USA" and are using a different profile than 2GT. GT2 and GT3 share the same profile and are 100% compatible. GT3 name is only for belt, it is a new version with a better construction. There is no GT3 pulleys as this naming is for belt only (pulleys are therefore GT2).

## Non-genuine GT2 belt

Those belts have probably 2GT profile but with all the naming chaos and unknown source you might have something else. I highly recommend to use genuine Gates belt for such an important part.


## Pulley Outside Diameter

`pd = P*N / π`

`O.D. = pd - 2*U`

Where
  * pd = pitch diameter
  * P = belt pitch
  * N = number of pulley teeth
  * O.D. = pulley outside diameter
  * U = Distance from Pitch Line to Belt Tooth Bottom
    * U = 0.254mm for 2GT and GT2/3 2mm pitch belts
    * U = 0.381mm for 3GT and GT2/3 3mm pitch belts

Example for GT3 2mm pitch and 20T pulley :
  * `pd = 2 * 20 / π = 12.732mm`
  * `O.D. = 12.732 - 2*0.254 = 12.224mm`
