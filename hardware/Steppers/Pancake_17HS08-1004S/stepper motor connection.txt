The order of the wires coming from the coil pairs inside the stepper motor changes from motor to motor. The easiest way to find out the coil pairs would be to use a multi meter on continuity mode. You should get a continuity reading from the A+ and A- coil and B+ and B-coil. In terms of the connection to the board they often have the connection order that the board expects on the silkscreen print.
