If you haven’t already, check out the Voron Discord. It has the info you’re looking for and much more. Here’s a quick copy paste from Volcom:

Q) What are the recommended print settings for Voron parts?

A)

0.2mm layer height, force .4mm extrusion width, 40% infill, 4 perimeters, and 5 top/bottom layers.

The following parts should be 5 perimeters, 8 top and bottom layers and 50% infill: xy_topbrace_left, xy_topbrace_right, idler_frame_left_lower/upper, and idler_frame_right_lower/upper. These only appear on V2 Printers

Supports are not required.

Recommended Infill Pattern is Fast Honeycomb in S3D, other valid infill is as follows: Gyroid, Cubic, Grid and Triangle.

Tested Slicers are as follows: S3D, PrusaSlicer, Cura, and KISS

We do not recommend using Pathio to slice your parts.

Approved filament is either ABS or ABS+.

No, PETG will not work. Dont use polycarbonate or nylon either, machines have failed with these materials catastrophically.

Filled filaments make your shit look awesome, but much more prone to layer separation, dont use them

No annealed PLA, its too brittle and has absolutely shit tolerances after the annealing process.

Standard PLA is only acceptable on items outside the chamber; ie: display housing, skirts, panel clips, handles.

Do not print any of the motion system in anything but ABS.
